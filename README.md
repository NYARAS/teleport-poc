# Teleport poc

Teleport is a Certificate Authority and an Access Plane for infrastructure.

Teleport facilitates Identity-Based_security, meaning that people who do not match the specified idenity will not be given access to any of your infrastructure. This reduces securiy threats and the impact that intruders can cause to your infrastructure.

## Benefits of this security approach is:

* You will know the identity of everyone who has accessed your infrastructure(Kubernetes, Web Apps, Databases, Virtual Machines etc).
* You can see the interactions performed on these servers for security audits or for debugging purposes.
